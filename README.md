# Todo Sandbox Frontend
This is the frontend for a todo sandbox app, which consumes the API described at https://github.com/Iprogrammerr/todo-sandbox. The UI layouts for the app can be found at https://www.figma.com/file/Dhj5IGwRovd9BTuDprbP2j/todo-app?node-id=0%3A1&t=8LfNNGR5ZW9rLTOF-0.

## Tech Stack
The frontend should be implemented using Vue 3 and built with Vite. Styles should be written in either plain CSS(BEM methodology) or Tailwind CSS.
